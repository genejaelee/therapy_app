				<p>Two simple words. They were so hard to say.</p>
				<p>I was nervous to try a therapist. I was skeptical too. But I wanted to feel better. I tried.</p>

				<h2>Try here.</h2>
				<p>If you've considered talking to a therapist for any reason at allâ€” this is for you. It's just an easy way to try.</p>
